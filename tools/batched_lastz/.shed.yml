  LASTZ is designed to preprocess one sequence or set of sequences
  (which we collectively call the TARGET) and then align several
  QUERY sequences to it. LASTZ_D is a non-integer (D stands for Double)
  version of LASTZ that can be used to estimate substitution matrix
  that will be used to score alignments.
